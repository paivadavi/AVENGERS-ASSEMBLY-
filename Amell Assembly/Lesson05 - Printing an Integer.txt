Lesson 04 - Printing a Character

As usual, we need to have the sections .data and .text

.data : in this program, this is where we declare the myCharacter variable

.text: in this program, this is where we give our instructions

*When we want to declare an integer, we declare a "variable" of type .word, because a .word in MIPS has 32 bits and that is what an integer value needs.
