LESSON 03 - HELLO ASSEMBLY

*Every MIPS program has two sections: The data section and the text section

.data = has all the data in your program. In Java and C++, those would be the variables

.text = has all the instructions that your program needs.

syscall tells the computer to execute your previous instructions.
