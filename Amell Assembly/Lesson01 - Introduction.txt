Lesson 02 - 

What are registers? 

They are located inside the CPU

They are very small memory units

They are the fastest memory inside your PC

You don't have many registers

Registers are like variables

Registers vs Variables = Registers allow you to store information, like variables. But the difference is that variables store information in the RAM, and registers store infromation inside the Processor.

Assembly gives you more control than any higher 0level programming language.

t registers are used to store information.

s registers are similar to the t registers.
